EcoSphere – A Global Sustainability & Environmental Intelligence Platform

"Track, Predict, and Sustain – A Smarter Future for Our Planet!"

🌍 Overview

EcoSphere is an AI-driven sustainability and environmental intelligence platform that helps individuals, businesses, and government organizations track carbon footprints, predict forest fires, optimize crop selection for farmers, and invest in green initiatives. It integrates AI, data analytics, and predictive modeling to promote sustainable living, environmental safety, and agricultural efficiency.

🚀 Key Features

✅ Carbon Footprint Calculator – Calculates CO₂ emissions based on user inputs (daily activities, travel, and energy consumption).
✅ Environmental Impact Visualization – Shows how emissions affect the environment, including the number of trees harmed.
✅ Carbon Tax & Offsetting – Converts CO₂ emissions into a monetary carbon tax and allows users to offset emissions via solar, wind, and reforestation projects.
✅ SuperCoins Reward System – Earn redeemable SuperCoins for offsetting emissions, incentivizing eco-friendly actions.
✅ AI-Powered Insights – Provides actionable recommendations to reduce carbon footprints efficiently.
✅ Forest Fire Prediction & Risk Mapping – Collaborates with the forest department to use AI-driven wildfire prediction models and map high-risk regions.
✅ Optimal Crop Prediction for Farmers – Uses machine learning algorithms to recommend the best crops based on soil conditions, area size, humidity, temperature, and rainfall.
✅ Community & Awareness – Connect with like-minded individuals, participate in sustainability challenges, and learn eco-friendly practices.
